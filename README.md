# She Who Laughs, He Who Laughs Loudest

The ratings for each individual episode are gathered using a web scraper that first updates the episode information using an IMDb Python package and then parses the data with Beautiful Soup. Thus, [friends.py](https://github.com/PerplexCity/SheLaughs_HeLaughs/blob/master/friends.py) writes to the [friends.csv](https://github.com/PerplexCity/SheLaughs_HeLaughs/blob/master/friends.csv) file, and [seinfeld.py](https://github.com/PerplexCity/SheLaughs_HeLaughs/blob/master/seinfeld.py) writes to the [seinfeld.csv](https://github.com/PerplexCity/SheLaughs_HeLaughs/blob/master/seinfeld.csv) file. 

One thing to note for all these ratings is that the ["average" that IMDb prints](http://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?ratingsexplanation) was not used because it is a filtered "Bayesian Average," which means that IMDb tries to sort out unscrupulous voting and then attaches a weight to it first to balance out episodes that have few ratings and are therefore vulnerable to extreme reviews. It's a strategy that most rating aggregator sites use. However, since IMDb doesn't tell us their formula, and since they only rate to a single decimal place, we will reconstruct the true averages by summing up the 1s, 2s, ... 9s, and 10s. 

The ratings for all the NYC sitcoms isn't as straightforward. I had to manually trim [Wikipedia's list of NYC shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_television_shows_set_in_New_York_City) to the ones that counted (post-1990 sitcoms). I probably could have simply clicked the IMDb link from each individual Wikipedia page, since the total wasn't that many (~50), but I went ahead and wrote another scraper, [sitcoms_all.py](https://github.com/PerplexCity/SheLaughs_HeLaughs/blob/master/sitcoms_all.py) that grabbed the IMDb link from the Wikipedia article and then fed the links into the same ratings grabber from the Seinfeld and Friends scripts. Not super efficient or error-free, but [nyshows.csv](https://github.com/PerplexCity/SheLaughs_HeLaughs/blob/master/nyshows.csv) was the result.

Once the datasets were ready/cleaned, some extra info was added (episode title for a select few, lead role gender for the all shows file), they were fed into the [shows.R](https://github.com/PerplexCity/SheLaughs_HeLaughs/blob/master/shows.R) script to be visualized.
